# Face-Mask-detection
Face mask detection using OpenCV face detection and VGG19 for a final mask-nomask classification.

I did this project to put into practice theorical knowledge that I learned reading Fran√ßois Chollet's book about Deep Learning with Keras and Python.
The main goal is to train a Convolutional Neural Network, VGG19 in this case, to predict if a person is wearing a mask or not. This neural network does not predict bounding boxes, so I had to use a pre-trained neural network from OpenCV to detect faces first.
